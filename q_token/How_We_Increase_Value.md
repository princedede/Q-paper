## How **QFOUR Token** Will Get More Value

------------------------------------------

- **QFT** as a utility token that gives holders access to the Quatrefinance ecosystem and its products. Most Quatrefinance's products are built with features desired by users with quests to have full control over their funds and have things done without exposing their identity. They're accessible when user own the required minimal amount of **QFT** in their wallets. More demand for Q-Products equivalents to higher needs for **QFT**. The resultant effect is obviously a significant increase in market value.

- It is worthy of note that some of these products may require no gas from user, that is, user may not need to hold network asset (such as ETH or AVAX) in their wallet before they use it. However, they may in turn be required to pay a minimal amount of fee in **QFT**. This we hope to integrate in near future.


#### BuyBack
- The Quatrefinance team will perform periodic buyBack from the proceed that may be generated from the various products. A certain percentage of the buyBack will be sent to a blackhole and the token is lost forever. We believe this tactic will mop out exceess token from circulation and eventually create scarcity hence higher value. However, we consider this method as secondary means of creating value for **QFT**.

- As users commit their token to earn more from the farm, the total Supply is decreases alongside while increases demand and in turn announces higher market worth for **QFOUR Token**.
