## Understand QFOUR Token metrics
**QFOUR** Token (ERC20 standard) is the native token of the QuatreFinance platform with enormously foreseeable use cases deployed and verifiable at **[Address](http://avascan.com)** : **[Address](http://avascan.com)**.

**Name** | **QFOUR Token**
-------- | ---------------
**Token Type** | **ERC-20 Standard**
**Ticker(Symbol)** | **QFT**
**Decimals** | **18**
**Max Supply** | **1_000_000_000** x **10** ** **Decimals**
**Total Supply** | _vary_
**CurrentSupply** | **Total Supply** _(may vary)_

**QFOUR Token** : initially emmitted at [[:Tx Hash]](http://avascan.com) at construction time is housed, mintable in the [[Farm]](http://avascan.com). Total amount of **`QFT`** the farm is able to mint in the contract lifeTime cannot exceed amount of **_Max Supply_** (See fig. 1.1). Access control is enforced on `burn()`. It is available only to the Farm: controlled by _[this multisig]()_. Such control however does not in any way directly or indirectly hinder free token movement and all public methods specified in the _[ERC20 Token standard]()_. **QFT** has a built-in staking method. For more infomation, see the _[API section]()_.

### Token-Burn
We employed this mechanism to compliment the methods we have devised for creating scarcity to create value for **QFT**. Based on our model, the farm needs to have more control on supply in circulation. **QFT** is designed to call for value via its use cases and a special staking algorithm which temporarily mops out token from circulation as demand for staking increases and similarly emits when unstaked. Such need is tied to virtually all the ecosystem's products.

The team will perform periodic buyback and percentage burn on a periodic basis or as the team deem fit which will be communicated in our various channels.
