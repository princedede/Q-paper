Quatre-finance is a platform for decentralized digital services that aims not to completely uninstall the application world but to continually reemphasize the need for true decentralization by building decentralized products tailored to individual needs. It is built on the Binance smart chain technology.

### Why Binance Smart Chain?
Every EVM compatible technologies have one thing that differentiates them from one another. We chose Binance for a couple of reasons. Some of which states: 

* It is Ethereum virtual machines compatible i.e it capable of executing smart contracts.
* It is preferred for its low transaction fees.
* Binance smart chain network encourages Borderless decentralized finance (DeFi).
* Its performance is suitable for mass adoption.

Leveraging on the use cases of blockchain technology such as the distributive and immutability features via smart contract architecture, we established Quatre-finance protocol that inherits the existing blockchain attributes with added rules.

### Highly Decentralized
Even with some decentralized finance platforms, you're still at the mercy of someone. At Quatre-finance, you decide which way to go. 
Quatre products and core value always consider a four-sided properties thus:
- Own it.
- control it.
- be fair.
- trust less.

#### Own it
Quatre products brings you to the position of an owner. Most of the accessility requests are tied to user's response rather than having to entrust your approval in third party services. We build it : you own it.

#### Control it
> Knowing you're in control is the first assurance of security.
Control is preceded by ownership. In fact they go hand in hand. The Quatre protocol brings you a high level of control over your assets/funds. If you engage in any of the Quatre-finance's p2p products, control is mutual while you also retain a good amount of ownership.

#### Be fair
We believe in fair dealings. Even while control and ownership belongs to a user, our protocol ensures that other parties involved with you in any transaction are fairly treated without jeopardizing your control.

#### Trust less
This is an inherently-interesting blockchain feature that Quatre-finance builds upon. With this, Alice does not need to know or have Bob's trust in order to transact without fear. Quatre protocol gives you rest of mind with whoever behind the scene you're dealing with.


## Understanding the FOUR Token
**FOUR** : (BEP20 standard : Binance smart chain) is the native token of the Quatre-finance platform with enormously foreseeable use cases deployed and verifiable at [BScscan](http://bscscan.com).

**Name** | **QFOUR Token**
-------- | ---------------
**Ticker(Symbol)** | **FOUR**
**Decimals** | **18**
**Max Supply** | **500_000_000** x **10** ** **Decimals**
**Total Supply** | _vary_
**CurrentSupply** | **Total Supply**

The **FOUR** Token is controlled by smart contract at [[Contract Address]](http://bscscan.com) which is owned by the [[Farmer Contract Address]](http://bscscan.com). The instruction is set at construction time for the farmer can only mint a total lifeTime amount of **_Max Supply_**. The farmer is a fair minter, never allows token be burnt by anyone but has a mechanism for creating scarcity to bring greater value to the **FOUR Token**. 

### Farmer does not allow token burn. But Why?
The cryptocurrency space is filled with the notions that only token burn can expose it to a higher value but **QFOUR Token** is designed to call for value via its use cases and a special staking algorithm which mops out token from circulation as staking increases and similarl emits when unstaked.
  * #### How is works: 
  For instance, in the Buy and Sel category, to keep the system healthy, a user who need to create     seller account is required to have some amount of **FOUR** Token staked in the proxy. When the       ```stake()``` is called, it switches the farmer to what we termed **_Sedentary mode_** which
    renders the caller's staked balance inactive for the period as long

`NOTE`: At any given time, **_CurrentSupply_** will always equal **_TotalSupply_**
