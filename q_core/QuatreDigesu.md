Modelling against a prominent ancient African financial scheme where few people from a community or related settings come together to fund one another by pooling resources passing it rotationally, Quaterfinance **Digesu** aims to uphold the social spirit while providing solutions to the shortcomings. Think of a group of people in a setting who have agreed to peer-fund one another to finance either new business, a project or non-profit endeavors, usually agreeing on a certain rules of participation, pool financial resource together to finance one another rotationally. There are two sides to QuatreDigesu:

**1)**. People from the same community or anyone around the world who is connected to the internet can participate by either creating a community or join existing community. When an user creates a community (private), they restrict participation to the preregistered participants. This indicates that a set of people who are familiar with one another have concluded to raise finance at an agreed amount hence they approached Digesu to establish such agreement. Every participants is regarded  as a borrower and lender at the same hence interest charges is removed. The **public band** is ideal for an user looking to join an existing community. Anyone can launch a public band. The differences and similarities are itemize below

Settings | PUBLIC | PRIVATE
-------- | ------------ | -----------
Create | Anyone can create band | Anyone or a representative can launch a band
participants | The creator only specifies the expected number of participants i.e Quorum | Supplies list of participants' addresses at creeation
Interest | - | -
Duration | Sets the duration(i.e period of use after which funds should be returned to the pool | Same as public
Collateral Index | Sets collateral multiplier (This determines the value of collateral deposit) | Same as public

**2).** This is the bigger picture and long-term vision of QuatreDigesu. The goal is to bring blockchain potentials to doorstep of every Africans and beyond to encourage saving: market men and women, traders, artisans, the office man and so on using a blend of web2 and web3. An average African (either trader or not) saves a smaller part of their income daily. Even though the level of saving is quite low, QuatreDigesu will drive and push the exitement of saving.
With Digesu, an African with the least mobile device standard will be able to save without having to worry about the safety and withdrawal of their funds.

#### Problems
Since money and people are involved, `trust` is a major issue to deal with and questions such as:

- Will the next paticipants fulfill their obligation?
- Will they pay back in full?
- How do we get our money if they default?
- I do not know Mr. B hence I cant peer-fund with him.
- One ajo man ran away with my money, so I am afraid to save.
- It is stressfull to join queues in the bank.
- I do not know how to use band Apps. Besides, I am saving as little as NGN100 etc

#### How we solve it
At Quatrefinance, we harness the potentials of blockchain technology to solve existing or emerging problems in the African societies and globally. Our solutions go beyond connecting the African communities but the world at large. This implies that anyone around the world can participate in the scheme in a decentralized manner. Our software (Digesu) will not only ensure cooperations but also enforces actions to protect the rights of every participants, encouraging saving and boost the economy on a long-run.

<!-- 
We represent thus:
- With collaterized:
  **Minimum QFT Holding** = **unit per head** x **Quorum**

- Without collaterized
  **Minimum QFT Holding** = **unit per head** x **Quorum** x **collateral factor**

`NOTE`: The pool admin (creator) may raise the collateral index at creation point. If this happens, the effect will be a correponding raise in the amount of **QFT holding** needed to get financed.
 -->


#### How it works
--------------
- Visit the website to launch the [app page](https://quatre.finance)

**1.** **Creating a band**

  - Strict mode

Assume Bob, Alice and Gorimapa have agreed to set up a pool of three persons to raise funds among themselves with unit amount of **1 ETH** for a total cycle of 15 days. Agreeing to set collateral to 1.2 of the total pool using **QFT** as the collateral base, we then have the following settings to launch a new pool:

  - **Amount** : **1 BNB**.
  - **Quorum** : **3**.
  - **Duration** : **5 days**.
  - **Collateral Index** : **120**. 
  - ~**Collateral Address** : **QFT Token Contract address**~.
  - **Participants** : **A list of participating addresses** in the case of private band.

**NOTE**: Supplying addresses will restrict anyone other than the broadcasted participants to make deposit to the pool.

--------------------

#### onFinance

Soon as the quorum value is reached, the total pool amount becomes available to the first on the list as preserved at creation. It continues in a rotational order if there is no default from the previous taker. This sets a lock on their **QFT** holding until the loan is repaid. Participant whose turn is to get financed must possess **QFT** in their wallet of an amount not less than the unit funding multiplied by the **Quorum** (total number of particiants) multiplied by the collateral factor.

##### onDefault

Participant who got financed may decide to amortize the loan or pay all at once but must complete the total repayment amount before the duration elapsed. If the otherwise happens, anyone (who must be a member of the pool) may liquidate the defaulter. In this case, their **QFT** is confiscated and use to set off the loan. 


  - Non-Strict mode

In contrast to the strict mode, the creator may allow anyone to join their pool. This mean, as the creator, you do not have to explicitly add participants to your community. Anyone may select to join in but the initial setting will slightly change from that of strict mode. Please use the designated function for this purpose. 

-----------------

**2.** **Joining existing pool**

A pool we created in non-strict mode is visible and allowance is set to true for anyone to join.
**NOTE**: Intending participant must have amount in base currency sufficient to pay for unit amount plus gas fee (usually minimal).  



**`NOTE :`** _Quatre-finance does not have control over funds in any of the pools. In fact, we have no way to access it_.

---------------------------


<!-- #### Participating benefit

At Quatrefinance each pool matters as they help strengthening the protocol. For the participants, activating a pool qualifies them to participate in the farming of **Quatrefinance Token - QFT** while completing a cycle qualifies them to earn farmed reward also as burning mechanism. However, this is not to be confused for reward for staking as the base rate for the former is lesser than latter. -->

<!-- Benefits come in the following ways: 

- _Interest on lending and borrowing_
- _Benefits of utilizing the pool to generate more profits_
- _Reward for participating in the protocol_
- _Staking benefit_ -->

--------------------------
<!-- 
#### The goal
The target is to enable anyone across the globe to access 

 a moderate short-term loan by providing a quota with promise to return (without default) the full amount together with accrued interest, and direct it to any profit-yielding endeavor (s) of their choice or access credits using existing portfolio as collateral. We cannot also rule out the reward aspect where participants are rewarded for staking as well as participating in the protocol.  -->
