### Quatre Buy and Sell (Q-BandS)

This category operates similar to the traditional way of buying and selling crypto assets but with unique differences and features thus:
- Absence of a middle person or intermediary such as the case with centralized exchanges.
- No KYC is needed.
- Seller creates a one-time flexible account (added to the pool of sellers on the Quatre page) that absolutely belongs to them. Flexibility means that it can be added/listed both on centralized and decentralized exchanges for greater visibility. In this regards, the compatibility also matters. 

`Note`: Cross-listing may remove the **no-kyc** feature. So users are at liberty to make a choice. Anyone can be referred to directly buy from same seller repeatedly.

- Prices are solely determined and set by the seller. Our protocol handles all necessary and underlying calculations, checks and balances for achieving precision.
- Buyers and sellers are protected.
- Free from CEX's regulations and demands.
- Your funds is in your custody.
- Sell as much as you want.
- Withdraw as much as you want.
