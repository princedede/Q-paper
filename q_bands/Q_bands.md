### Quatre Buy and Sell (Q-BandS)

This category operates similar to the usual way of buy and selling crypto assets but with uniques differences and features thus:
- No centralized exchange or intermediary.
- No KYC is needed.
- Seller creates a one-time flexible account (added to the pool of sellers on the Quatre page) that absolutely belongs to them. Flexibility means that it can be added/listed on our partners's exchange for greater visibility(coming soon...). `Note`: this may remove the **no-kyc** feature. Anyone can be referred to directly buy from same seller repeatedly.
- Prices are solely determined and set by the seller. Our protocol handles all necessary and underlying calculations, checks and balances for achieving precision.
- Free from CEX's regulations and demands.
- Your funds stay with you.
- Sell as much as you want.
- Withdraw as much as want.
