#### FAQ - Q-LandB

- **What is a proxy account?**
An account created solely for an user blended with their signatures with owner and control of it. In the case of **Q-LandB**, A proxy administers and manages lending and borrowig relationship between the owner and the borrower.

- **What do I need to set up a proxy account?**
    - Have the _[minimumstakingAmount]()_ (in QFT) in your wallet.
    - Have the _[minimum creation fee]()_ in _**BNB**_.
    - Hit the required button and a proxy is launched for you. The minimum stake amount is deducted from your EOA and staked in favor of the proxy created amount which is locked for as long as the proxy runs. The reward for minimum stake amount accrues as well. 
    - There is a one-time creation fee which is very minimal with repect to the network it is deployed to.

- **Who updates the Proxy parameters?**
Owner of course! And that's the initiator. As the initiator, we provide you with detailed information on how to updated any of the upgradeable parameters such as the price, interest rate etc.

- **What if I need to close my account?**
You are fee to stop your proxy from running at any time. However there two options with which you can do this: 
    `pause`: You can pause your account so one can perform any buy transaction. But does not unstake the initial minimum stake amount.
    `closeOut`: Closing your account permanently deactivates your account from the database. Even though the identifier address is visible, yet it cannot perform any transaction again. Before this is done, your initial minimum stake amount is unstaked and sent to your recognized address together with accrued reward to date.

- **Any potential risk involved?**
Your account (Proxy) hold values hence should be valued and protected. An access to your account (EOA with which youu created it) should be well secured. The proxy is securely built to resist unwanted actions on sensitive settings other than you from external sources but we do not have control over external actions that may be supercharged to it either in the course of owner's negligence or superadded activities from the direct users.

**`NOTE :`** _Quatre-finance does not have control over your account or funds. In fact, we have no way to access it. You own it._
