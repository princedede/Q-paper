### What is Quatre-Finance?
Quatre-finance is a platform for decentralized applications. We aim not to completely uninstall the application world but re-emphasizing the need for true decentralization. while building decentralized products tailored to individual needs putting them in complete control of their funds and/or investments, our concepts are not limited to the following:

- Our core product and ideology is centered around creating a platform for users to easily access crypto loan via a rotational peer-to-peer system for a short period of time usually 7 days.

- It also allows traders and crypto holders to earn in different ways such as lending out their assets to be used by another while retaining the ownership at the same time earning lender's interest.

- Traders looking to borrow on a short-term basis, can join the Q-core pool, move it to exchange to make more profits leveraging on their existing portfolio as collateral. In this pool, they also become a lender.

- With Quatrefinance decentralized lending protocol (Q-Lend), fund owners who wish to play safe and retain full ownership and control of their funds can unilaterally set up (from our proxy-based) a public - private inclined exchange for themselves where they can lend platform-compatible assets to others at a profitable interest. The goal is to create a competitive interest atmostphere where lenders give out loan at a rate they are most convenient with. 

- Q-BandS gives benefits similar to that of _**Q-Lend**_ when anyone runs the proxy-based account that allows them to sell crypto to anyone directly without a third party involvement. See the _[Q-Lend Section](https://github.com/Quatre-Finance/Q-paper/blob/main/q_lend/QLend.md#quatre-landb-q-landb)_

Our incentivized program (s) allow investors, liquidity provider and participants in the network to make more from their commitments, time and participation.

### Problems

- Barriers to fast adoption posed by centralized blockchain operators such as rigorous KYCs etc.
- Trust issues between parties to trade.
- Security problems with some open and fully decentralized operators.
- Loss of fund in the event of demise.
- Low adoption due to technical nature of blockchain technology.

------------------------

### Our Solutions

- We are creating a protocol that removes the need for trust.
- A truly decentralized platform with no kyc.
- Raising standards above the limit of existing decentralized operators.
- Better user interface and integration to accomodate average internet users.
- Improve wallet service to reduce funds being stolen or locked forver.


### Mission

To build decentralized protocols, using blockchain technologies in a trustless environments that manage both financial and non-financial relationships between parties.  

----------------------------


###  Highly Decentralized
Even with some decentralized finance platforms, you're still at the mercy of someone. At Quatre-finance, you decide which way to go: if your decision is fairly reasonable enough regarding the rights of your counterparties.

Our products and core value will always consider a four-sided properties thus:
- Own it.
- control it.
- be fair.
- trust less.


#### Own it
Quatre products gives the fulfilment of ownership. Most of our products are (and will be) designed to brings you ownership experience. Accessility to your funds are hashed with your signature and you don't have to be at the mercy of any centralized exchange platform to bring in or take take out your funds. We build it : you own it.

#### Control it
> Knowing you're in control is the first assurance of security.

Control is preceded by ownership. In fact they go hand in hand. The Quatre protocol brings you a high level of control over your assets/funds. If you engage in any of the Quatre-finance's p2p products, control is mutual while you also retain a good amount of ownership.

#### Be fair
We believe in fair dealings. While control and ownership belongs to the user, we on the fair side ensures that counterparties in any transaction are fairly treated without jeopardizing your need for control.

#### Trust less
This is an inherently-interesting blockchain feature that Quatre-finance builds upon. With this, Alice does not need to know or have Bob's trust in order to transact with him. Quatre protocol gives you rest of mind even while the identity of the other party is preserved.

----------------------

### Technology.
The Quatrefinance's protocols will be built on EVM compatible networks (we may extend to more technologies in the future as our mission statement requires that we consistently build on the same Quatrefinance platform). From our research, we are looking to extend to one or more technologies:
<!-- - Avalanche
- Polygon
- Binance Smart Chain

#### Take a look at the following quotes: 

- **[Avalanche](https://docs.avax.network/)**: 
> A key difference between Avalanche and other decentralized networks is the consensus protocol. Over time, people have come to a false understanding that blockchains have to be slow and not scalable. The Avalanche protocol employs a novel approach to consensus to achieve its strong safety guarantees, quick finality, and high-throughput without compromising decentralization.

- **[Polygon](https://polygon.technology/)**: 
> Polygon is a protocol and a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Aggregating scalable solutions on Ethereum supporting a multi-chain Ethereum ecosystem.

- **[Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain)**:
> This dual-chain architecture will empower its users to build their decentralized apps and digital assets on one blockchain and take advantage of the fast trading to exchange on the other.
 -->
Every EVM compatible technologies have one or more uniqueness (es). Some factors we consider: 

* Should be Ethereum virtual machines compatible. That is, capability of executing smart contracts instructions which we deem suitable for implemeting our backend written in solidity language.

* With considerably low transaction fees.
* Should encourage Borderless decentralized finance (DeFi) that allows anyone around the globe with an internet service to access our services.
* Among others, its performance should be suitable for mass adoption.

We are leveraging on the use cases of blockchain technology such as the distributive, permissionless and immutability features via smart contract architecture, we established Quatre-finance protocol that inherits the modern blockchain attributes with customised rules.

We have consider leveraging the aforementioned potentials of the Avalanche platform to compliment our intuition.
