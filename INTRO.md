### What is Quatre-Finance?
Quatre-finance is a platform for decentralized digital services that aims not to completely uninstall the application world but to continually re-emphasize the need for true decentralization while building decentralized products tailored to individual needs putting them in complete control of their funds and/or investments. Some primary use cases of the Quatrefinance platform are not limited to the following:

- Our core product and ideology is centered around creating a platform for users to easily access crypto loan via a rotational peer-to-peer system for a short period of time usually 7 days.

- It also allows traders and crypto holders to earn in different ways such as lending out their assets to be used by another while retaining the ownership at the same time earning lender's interest.

- Traders looking to borrow on a short-term basis, can join the Q-core pool, move it to exchange to make more profits leveraging on their existing portfolio as collateral. In this pool, they also become a lender.

- With Quatrefinance decentralized lending protocol (Q-Lend), fund owners who wish to play safe and retain full ownership and control of their funds can unilaterally set up (from our proxy-based) a public - private inclined exchange for themselves where they can lend any ERC20 or AVAX compatible assets to others at interest they're willing to give it out. The goal is to create a competitive interest atmostphere where lenders give out loan at a rate they are most convenient with. 

- Q-BandS gives benefits similar to that of _**Q-Lend**_ when anyone runs the proxy-based account that allows them to sell crypto to anyone directly without a third party involvement. See the _[Q-Lend Section](https://github.com/Quatre-Finance/Q-paper/blob/main/q_lend/QLend.md#quatre-landb-q-landb)_

Our incentivized program (s) allow investors, liquidity provider and participants in the network to make more from their committed funds, time and participation.

Our mission is to build decentralized protocols that create and manage both financial and non-financial relationships between parties to trade (lenders and borrowers, buyers and sellers or as the case may be from time to time) exempting an intermediary, with either of the parties not necessarily having to know or trust who they are dealing with in a manner that regards the right of both parties while giving them equal control commensurate to their position in the trade at that point, and everyone is happy in the end.

### Quatre-finance underlying technology.
The protocol will exist both on the Avalance network as we consider other chains in the future. The former ranks first on our list of preferences even though we strongly consider other technologies.

#### Why Avalanche network?

Take a look at the following quoted from **[Avalanche](https://docs.avax.network/)**: 
> A key difference between Avalanche and other decentralized networks is the consensus protocol. Over time, people have come to a false understanding that blockchains have to be slow and not scalable. The Avalanche protocol employs a novel approach to consensus to achieve its strong safety guarantees, quick finality, and high-throughput without compromising decentralization.

Every EVM compatible technologies have one or more uniqueness (es). We chose Avalanche for a couple of reasons. Some of which are thus: 

* It is Ethereum virtual machines compatible. That is, it is capable of executing smart contracts instructions which we deem suitable for implemeting our backend written in solidity language.

* Avalanche is preferred for its considerably low transaction fees.
* It encourages Borderless decentralized finance (DeFi) that allows anyone around the globe with an internet service to access our services.
* Among others, its performance is suitable for mass adoption.

Leveraging on the use cases of blockchain technology such as the distributive, permissionless and immutability features via smart contract architecture, we established Quatre-finance protocol that inherits the modern blockchain attributes with customised rules.

We have consider leveraging the aforementioned potentials of the Avalanche platform to compliment our intuition.

###  Highly Decentralized
Even with some decentralized finance platforms, you're still at the mercy of someone. At Quatre-finance, you decide which way to go: if your decision is fairly reasonable enough regarding the rights of your counterparties.

Our products and core value will always consider a four-sided properties thus:
- Own it.
- control it.
- be fair.
- trust less.


#### Own it
Quatre products gives the fulfilment of ownership. Most of our products are (and will be) designed to brings you ownership experience. Accessility to your funds are hashed with your signature and you don't have to be at the mercy of any centralized exchange platform to bring in or take take out your funds. We build it : you own it.

#### Control it
> Knowing you're in control is the first assurance of security.

Control is preceded by ownership. In fact they go hand in hand. The Quatre protocol brings you a high level of control over your assets/funds. If you engage in any of the Quatre-finance's p2p products, control is mutual while you also retain a good amount of ownership.

#### Be fair
We believe in fair dealings. While control and ownership belongs to the user, we on the fair side ensures that counterparties in any transaction are fairly treated without jeopardizing your need for control.

#### Trust less
This is an inherently-interesting blockchain feature that Quatre-finance builds upon. With this, Alice does not need to know or have Bob's trust in order to transact with him. Quatre protocol gives you rest of mind even while the identity of the other party is preserved.
